Hi!!

The first page (containing the loading, and has the mountain background) was NOT made by me. (of course the second page, including the CSS was made by me)

It was made by a group of 6 people, known as the cheating.win team, a group dedicated to cheating/hacking in games, before the owner got sued for copyright infringement
by Epic Games (I do not condone what they did)

I just managed to get their website source code before they went under, and just thought I'd share it with you because it looked cool.

Thanks for reading.
